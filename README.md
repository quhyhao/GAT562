GAT562 Mesh Trial Tracker
 GAT562 Mesh Trial Tracker is a communication and positioning terminal designed based on nRF52840 and SX1262, supporting LoRa and Bluetooth 5.0. It integrates power interface (5V USB, 2500mA lithium battery), built-in 1.3-inch TFT display and GPS module, with powerful remote communication capability, scalability and low-power design.
 GAT562 Mesh Trial Tracker is fully compatible with Meshtastic and can update the experience with the latest features in a Meshtastic network. Meshtastic is a community-driven open source project that allows reasonable use of LoRa radio for remote off-grid communication in areas without any existing or reliable communication infrastructure.
superiority
Decentralization: It does not rely on the central server or base station. Each device can be used as a relay node to forward information. There is no single point of failure in the network. Even if some nodes have problems, it will not affect the overall communication, and the reliability and stability of the network are higher.
Long-distance communication: Using wireless communication technologies such as LoRa, communication can be realized over several kilometers or even farther distances, with obvious advantages in remote areas without network coverage or in vast outdoor Spaces.
Offline communication: No need to rely on the Internet or mobile network, can communicate normally in places without cell phone signal or Wi-Fi, to meet the communication needs of special scenarios.
Low power consumption: The low-power Bluetooth Low Power (BLE) technology is adopted, which consumes less battery for hardware devices, can be used for a long time, is suitable for portable devices, and reduces the frequency and difficulty of charging.
Open source and customizable: The software is open source, and developers can freely modify and expand the code according to their own needs, carry out secondary development, add new functions or optimize existing functions, and meet the personalized needs of different users.
Cross-platform compatibility: It supports a variety of hardware devices and operating systems, and users can choose their own devices to access the network, such as mobile phones, tablets, etc., so that users of different devices can communicate with each other.
Low cost: The hardware used is usually the cheaper open source hardware module, which is much cheaper than professional communication equipment and easy to promote and use.
User-friendly interface: An intuitive and simple user interface is designed, so that even non-technical personnel can quickly get started, and it is convenient for users to perform device configuration, information sending, location sharing and other operations.
